                    Alba is a housecat. My first ever cats were her brother and her.
                    Her brother, Rocco, passed away a few years ago.
                    She is 18 years old, so she is old and mostly sleeps nowadays.
                    When she isn't though, she likes to sit on your lap and burry her head into your arm or stomach.
                    At night, she will lay on her own pillow next to mine, and purr loudly before she goes to sleep.

                <p>
                    Vida is a Yorkshire Terrier. We bought her from a family in our hometown when she was eight
                    weeks old. Today she is four years old. She loves carrying her toys around in her mouth.
                    If you're lucky, she will give you one.
                    On weekdays she attends a kindergarden-type place for dogs. She loves it there, she has her friends
                    and she gets to go on walk several times a day.

                <p>
                    Dia is a Cane Corso, a big dog who weighs 45 kilos.
                    She is four years old, and have been with me for a year now.
                    Her previous owner felt that she didn't have the time for a dog anymore.
                    Dias is a gentle giant. But she is a watchdog,
                    and she will growl at you if she thinks you're acting suspicous.
                    Every other day a dogwalker comes to take Dia and some other dogs out in the woods for play.

                <p>
                    Amos is a Maine Coon, a big cat. He is just a year old and weighs eight kilos.
                    They say that he will keep growing for another two or three years.
                    He is a good little boy who acts more like a dog. He likes to carry his toys around,
                    he always begs for treats and he likes to be wherever you are.
                    Him and Dia are especially good friends as they will play and sleep together.
